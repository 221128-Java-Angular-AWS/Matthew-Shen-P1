## Project-1: Expense Reinbursement System

In this project I created a mock expense reinnbursement system, where employees and managers may log in and submit/approve tickets. Some technologies used in this project were Java, SQL and Javalin. The archecture of this project follows a DAO pattern (or Data Access Object). This allows for the business/client layer to be isolated from the persistance layer.
